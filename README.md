# GIT-WC

This is a simple extension to GIT that reports the word count
difference between any two commits.  It accepts any standard range
arguments, such as HEAD^..HEAD or &lt;path&gt;..&lt;path&gt;, and tells you how
many words you added since your last commit, minus how many words you
have removed.

Without any arguments, it tells you the difference between your
working tree and the last commit.

I write stories as well as code, I use Markdown as my writing
environment of choice, I commit to a GIT repository regurlarly, and
this is a simple and straightforward way of tracking my daily
contributions.

The LICENSE is standard MIT style.  See the LICENSE file for details.
